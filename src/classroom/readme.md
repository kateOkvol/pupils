Create an array of instances of the Human class (first name + last name is enough). 

This array will be a set of students. Doing the following:

<li> Display all students in the console in the format “Student: <lastName>, <firstName>”
<li> Calculate and display in the console the number of all students in the group. “Students count: <count>”
<li> Calculate the required number of tables for students, based on the condition that a maximum of 2 people should sit at the table. Output to kosol in the format “Desks for class: <descCount>”
<li> Make the seating of students on the tables from left to right in alphabetical order, based on the condition that the tables are arranged in 3 rows. The number of rows is fixed (3). The number of tables is not fixed.
